    "knowledgetext": "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Linear regression is used for predicting continuous values, while classification algorithms like logistic regression and decision trees are used for predicting categories. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples. Clustering algorithms like K-means group similar data points together, while dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduce the number of features while preserving important information. Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Deep learning uses neural networks with many hidden layers to learn complex patterns in data. Training a machine learning model involves feeding it data, adjusting parameters to minimize prediction errors, and validating performance on unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to new data. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will perform on independent data. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming input variables to improve model performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error and R-squared for regression tasks."
